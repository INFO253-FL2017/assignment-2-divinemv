		<p>I'm not going to claim to be the world's greatest writer, but I do think I'm reasonably competent. I've been training for 25 years, and I make a living as a writer.</p> 
		<p>For those who are just starting out as writers, I'd like to share my training. I didn't wake up and suddenly know how to write -- I've been training for most of my life.</p>
		<p>A short background on my writing career: I started out as a sportswriter, as a senior in high school, and eventually became a full-time reporter and then editor for my local paper on Guam. I went on to do freelance writing for magazines and other publications, worked for awhile as a bill writer for lawmakers and a speechwriter for the Guam governor. Eventually I started my own blog while doing freelance blogging for about 5 different blogs. Finally, I've written my blog for almost 10 years now, and have written numerous books and courses.</p>
		<p>Here are the most important aspects of my training, in no particular order:</p>
		<ul id="cirle">
			<li><b>Read a lot.</b> The best writers (those far better than me) read voraciously. I read all the time -- fiction is my favorite, but I also read non-fiction books and long-form articles online. Reading good writing shapes your own writing, giving you inspiration and expanding your use of language. Read a lot!</li>

			<li><b>Steal from others.</b> When you find a writer who does something beautifully, rip them off. Try it in your own writing, mix it in with what you already do, remix it with what you find elsewhere, and make it your own.</li>

			<li><b>Keep notes on writing.</b> When you find something worth stealing, add it to a text doc or put it in a writing notebook. When you have ideas for a novel, a blog post, a character, an insight... add it to the notebook. Mine it regularly.</li>

			<li><b>Find fellow writers.</b> If you're having trouble sticking to a writing schedule, find other writers in your area or online, and meet with them regularly. Share your writing with each other, discuss problems you're having, read other writers in your genre. A small writing group is a time-tested tool, and helps you see that you're not in this alone.</li>

			<li><b>Understand the reader.</b> Another of the most important things I learned as a newspaper reporter was to understand the mindset of the reader. Many beginning writers just write whatever is in their heads, but then it might not be so understandable or interesting to the reader. These days I think in terms of how the reader will understand the article, what context they need, how clear my sentences are, what experience I'm creating for the reader.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>So that might seem like a lot to take on! It's doable, though, if you just keep churning away, every day, and learn all of this a little at a time.</p>
		<p>A few points I'd like to make for those who'd like to write:</p>

		<ul id="u1Circle">
			<li><b>Anyone can write, and everyone should.</b> You don't have to be James Joyce to write. Even if you never want to be a pro, you can write in a journal every day, or write letters to a loved one (and send them or not). You don't have to be polished. And it's a great practice, to learn to focus and overcome fears and procrastination, and learn to allow the words to flow from the mind.</li>

			<li><b>Start where you are.</b> Whether you've been writing for a few years or you're just starting out, whether you have a talent for words or you struggle, that is the place to start. It doesn't matter where you are, or how you compare to others -- just write, working with whatever you're struggling with. You'll get better over the course of time, and more comfortable with what you're doing.</li>

			<li><b>You get good by doing it a lot, and caring.</b> You'll never be perfect at it -- goodness knows I'm far from perfect -- but the only way to get better is to practice. And to care about what you're doing. Do that every day, and every step of the struggle will be an amazing one.</li>
		</ul>
